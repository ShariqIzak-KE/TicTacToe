One of the course projects on Day 84 of 100 Days of Code by Dr Angel Yu

Write down how you approached the project.

    Divide project into two milestones
        Text based version manual input
        AI Engine to play against user
    Steps for a Text based Version
        Create an 3 x 3 array and print it
        Find a way to refresh the screen and display it.
        Create Combination of wins to check against
        Show Array with numbers and different colors for X/O and 1,2,3...
        Create game engine
        ask user at each turn which number they want in the matrix, validate
        replace number in matrix
        Compare to win_matrix if any has won then loop to game engine again for different player
        ** Computer engine to play against User ** a) If Computer starts the game, steps on each turn:
            Play 1st Box
            Play a corner Box
            Check for a winning streak of 2 in any combination and repeat
            Repeat step 3 until comp wins b) If Player starts, steps on each turn:
            Comp first play is a corner
            check if player has a winning streak of 2 else play a corner box
            Check if comp has a winning streak of 2

What was hard, what was easy.

    Coming up with the comp strategy to play against the User was a definite challenge.
    it was nice to build a project in the command line fully, before adding any graphics. How might you improve for the next project?
    Add a score for the player and computer
    GUI

What was your biggest learning from today? What would you do differently

    Spending more time on the planning of functions, variable e.t.c.
    The devil is in the details :)

if you were to tackle this project again?

    Would definitely continue building on other improvements.
